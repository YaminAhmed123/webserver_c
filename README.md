Mhm........
I think i will take a deep breath.
After that i will take a long brake from that project and i will eventually return.
But for now i have an unidentiable bug.

I tried fixing it for like 5 Days straight each time 4-7h.
I was not able to. the last tests that are doc are in the death branch.

but for now.
Good bye   .__.
